      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>I am a Research Data Analysis at the Center of Food Security and the Environment at Stanford University. At Stanford, I work with Marshall Burke and Sam Heft-Neal on research aiming to identify causal relationship between climate extremities and health, social and economic outcomes. Some recent research combines households surveys with remote sensing data to examine environmental drivers of child health. </p>
      
      <h2>Research Training</h2>
      <p>My work with researchers at Stanford University and University of Chicago has trained me in a variety of economic research methods, like causal identification techniques employed to panel data.  </p>
      <p>
      Select research in-progress:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
  <li>Investigating marginal health effects of a degree rise in temperature dose in comparative risk framework in situations where incremental temperature dose might have opposite effects on health through different competitive channels. </li>
  <li>Identifying global causal estimates of particulate matter pollution on infant mortality using a novel instrumental variable approach. The motive here is to use high resolution local remote sensing data and to allow coefficients be informed completely by local pollution levels and thus 3</li>
  
      </ol>
<p>
  My experience with J-PAL have given me a valuable experience in working with government at multiple levels as well as sourcing and handling administrative and field data.

<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<p>
  I am usually very excited about variety of research ideas related to climate and society, governance, state capacity and political economy. These can be bucketed into two broad themes: 
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many parts of the world ( eg, Ganges basin in India and Bangladesh) already deal with extreme weather events at a frequency that is much higher than normal. I am interested in how society adapts, or under-adapts, to face the climactic events and what are the economic costs of such adaptation. </li>
  <li>I am obsessed with the concept of state capacity which seems to be highly predictive of a range of social and economic outcomes. Specifically, I am deeply interested in understanding how do we think of sub-optimal state capacity and leaky welfare delivery through political economy and public finance lens. The motivation here is to come up with effective ways to improve state capacity and governance in developing countries. </li>
  
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        Learnings from these research themes are likely to be extremely important in near future when we need to come up with immediate and effective ways to deal with climate change. Even as we need to achieve more and more lofty goals just to ensure human existence, figuring out how can we effectively build state capacity across many parts of the world to ensure we are making actual progress towards those goals would be indispensible. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I hold a Masters in Research Methods (MACRM) from University of Chicago Harris School and a Bachelors in Technology (B.Tech) from The LNM IIT, India.</p>
